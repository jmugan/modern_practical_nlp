# Modern Practical Natural Language Processing

This course will cover how you can use NLP to do stuff.

There are four videos
1. Overview and Converting Text to Vectors 
  * For finding similar documents
  * "I have this document or text, what others talk about the same stuff?"
  * [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiHB7Ap9wF4)
2. Learning with Vectors and Classification
  * For classifying documents
  * "I need to put these documents into buckets."
  * [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb4L_1QuIo0&fbclid)
3. Visualizing
  * For seeing what document vectors look like in 3D space
  * "I need to quickly see what looks similar to what."
  * [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Ea-5CjOgg&ab_channel=GlobalDataGeeks)
4. Sequence Generation and Extracting Pieces of Information from Text
  * For translation and document summarization, and for pulling out sentences and documents that talk about specific things
  * "I need every mention of a street address or business in Garland, Texas; and I need each document translated to Urdu."

# Additional Details

The idea is we make short videos that focus on the aspects of NLP that currently work well and are useful.

Speech-to-text now works pretty well, so these methods will also be useful for the audio portions of videos.

All code will be available on GitHub here https://github.com/jmugan/modern_practical_nlp

# About Me, Jonathan Mugan
* PhD in Computer Science in 2010 from UT Austin
* Thesis work was about how a robot could wake up in the world and figure out what is going on
* Work at [DeUmbra](https://deumbra.com/) where we build AI for the DoD
  * We also work in healthcare, which I can talk about. A future video (not in this series) will cover how we use graph neural networks to identify who is at risk for opioid overdose
  * Hands-on technical advisor at our sister company [Pulselight](https://www.pulselight.com/)
* Wrote [*The Curiosity Cycle: Preparing Your Child for the Ongoing Technological Explosion*](http://www.jonathanmugan.com/CuriosityCycle/)
* Advisor at [KUNGFU.AI](https://www.kungfu.ai/)
* Also do independent consulting work

# The Limits of NLP
## Computers can't read
* Reading requires mapping language to internal concepts grounded in behaving in the same general environment as the writer.
  * Computers don’t have those concepts.
  * Example: “I pulled the wagon.” Computers don’t know that wagons can carry things or that pulling exerts a gentle tension to the arm and leg muscles as one walks.

## Computers can't write
* Writing requires mapping internal concepts grounded in behaving in the same general environment as the expected reader.
  * Computers don’t have those concepts

## NLP Works Around Computers Not Having the Experience or Conceptual Framework to Read and Write
* NLP is about how to make natural language amenable to computation even though computers can’t read or write.
* Representing text as *vectors* has transformed NLP in the last 10 years.
* There are also *symbolic methods* that are practically useful; we will cover those too.
